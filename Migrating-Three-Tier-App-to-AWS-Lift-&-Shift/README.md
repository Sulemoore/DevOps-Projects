# Lift & Shift - Migrating a 3-Tier Web App to AWS

In this project we are going to lift and shift a web application hosted locally on our machine (this could be on premise of data center) to AWS.  Instead of running our workload in our data center, we run it on a cloud computing platform that we don't pay for the upfront cost for procuring the resource. We pay as we go based on consumption of infrastructure as a service. We get flexibility, elasticity, scalability,and cost control.

### AWS Services

- EC2 Instances: We will use ec2 instances as our VMs for TOMCAT, RABBITMQ, MEMCACHE, and MYSQL.
- ELB (Load balancer): ELB will replace the NGINX Load balancer
- ASG: For automatic VM scaling based on workload
- S3/EFS Storage: As a shared storage
- Route 53: Will be used for private DNS service
- IAM: For access management
- ACM: For managing certificates

### Flow of Execution
- Login to AWS Account
- Create Key Pairs
- Create Security groups
- Launch Instances with user data
- Update IP to name mapping in route 53
- Build application from source code
- Upload artifact to S3
- Download Artifact to Tomcat EC2 Instance
- Setup ELB with HTTPS
- Map EKB Endpoint to website
- Build Autoscaling Group for Tomcate instances
